# Welcome Home!

This guide will hopefully help answer any questions in our somewhat high-tech household.

# Outside

## Neighborhood

Syrenparken is a fairly quiet street with mostly small families and some middle-aged inhabitants. It is a safe and peaceful place.

Snejbjerg is a suberb of Herning city with enough shops/supermarkets to supplies. It is also on the edge of farmland so there are agricultural supplies as well.

Many restaurants in Herning wil gladly deliver to Snejbjerg, including pizza, burgers, sushi, and even bubble tea. Herning is about 5 kilometers east and can be reached by public transit (bus).

## Doors, Gates, Locks

Info about locking and unlocking our various ports.

- [House Doors](./doors.md#doors)
- [Garage Doors](./doors.md#garage-doors)
- [Gate](./doors.md#gate)
- [Shed doors](./doors.md#shed-doors)

The property is completely enclosed by walls, gates, and fences - this makes it safe for the dogs to run around without escaping.
Additionally, we've fenced off an area of "backyard" within our yard where the dogs can go outside in a more controlled environment for convenience.
