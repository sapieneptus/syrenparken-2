## Hue System

The majority of lights in the main house are [Hue Lights](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us). Note that, because of the high number of lights,
we have a separate Downstairs bridge and an Upstairs bridge. The only noteworthy exceptions are the upstairs hallway lights and the lights in the
rec room.

### Manual Control

#### App

You can connect to the light system by installing the Hue app and connecting to our bridges. 

The downstairs bridge is located in the utility closet. Be _very careful_ when moving things on the shelf, as it can easily fall.



The upstairs bridge is near the electrical box.



If you'd prefer not to install the app, you're welcome to utilize one of the wall tablets to control them. They both have the app installed and are connected to our bridges.

#### Wall Switches

You'll notice many areas of the house have two light switches: Hue switches and non-hue switches.

The non-hue switches are the ones that controll power to the lights, and the Hue switches control whether they're on or off (as well as color temperature settings).

For convenience/simplicity, in general, try to only use the Hue switches. If you use the other switches to turn them off, they'll no longer respond to the app controls and no longer work on the schedule (of course, if this is what you prefer, please feel free!).

### Automatic Schedule

The lights are set to automatically turn off at midnight if they're still on (they'll fade out from 00:00 to 00:15). 
The lights will begin fading on between 7:30-8:00 in the morning.

You can adjust this schedule in the app, if you prefer.

Note that the lights around the property (on the walls and outdoors) will automatically turn on at night, but they are not Hue lights and there is no direct way to control them.
