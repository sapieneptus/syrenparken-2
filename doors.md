## Doors

Our doors are fairly normal, but please take note of the following:

1. To Unlock the door, you need to pull the handle _up_ before locking it. TODO: Photo
2. The doors are (unfortunately) not auto-locking, so you'll need to manually lock them from the inside.
3. The doors must be _fully_ shut when turning on the alarm system. Otherwise, the alarm will trigger. This includes the garage door.

## Gate

The gate is on a motor and is remote-controlled. Pressing the 'A' button once will open or close it. It is a bit slow.
There is a button near the physical gate motor, but currently it doesn't work.

If necessary, you can detach the gate arms by releasing the pin-lock at the arm attachment (see photo). Please use caution when doing this!

## Garage Doors

The Garage Doors are opened using a remote ("1" is the left door, "2" is the right door).
We rarely use the door on the right, and it sometimes doesn't stay closed when using the remote. Both doors have manual controls as well. 

## Shed Doors

As you can see, the shed door is slightly off its hinge ever since a severe windstorm. So we are keeping it closed with a cinder block temporarily.
